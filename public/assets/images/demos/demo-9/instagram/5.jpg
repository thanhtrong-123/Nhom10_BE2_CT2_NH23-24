    <ol>
    <li>Check the web address for typos.</li>
    <li>Make sure your internet connection is working normally.</li>
    <li>Contact the website owner.</li>
    </ol>Get help with a specific error message"Your connection is not private" or "<span class="error-code">NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID</span>" or "<span class="error-code">ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID</span>" or "<span class="error-code">NET::ERR_CERT_WEAK_SIGNATURE_ALGORITHM</span>" or "<span class="error-code">ERR_CERT_SYMANTEC_LEGACY</span>" or "SSL certificate error""Connect to network""Your clock is behind" or "Your clock is ahead" or "<span class="error-code">NET::ERR_CERT_DATE_INVALID</span>"<h4>Step 1: Sign in to the portal</h4>
    <p>Wi-Fi networks at places like cafes or airports need you to sign in. To see the sign-in page, visit a page that uses <code>http://</code>.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Go to any website starting with <code>http://</code>, like <a href="http://example.com" target="_blank">http://example.com</a>.</li>
    <li>On the sign-in page that opens, sign in to use the internet.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Step 2: Open the page in Incognito mode (computer only)</h4>
    <p>Open the page you were visiting in an Incognito window.</p>
    <p>If the page opens, a Chrome extension isn't working right. To fix the error, turn off the extension.</p>
    <h4>Step 3: Update your operating system</h4>
    <p>Make sure your device is up-to-date.</p>
    <h4>Step 4: Temporarily turn off your antivirus</h4>
    <p>You'll see this error if you have antivirus software that provides "HTTPS protection" or "HTTPS scanning." The antivirus is preventing Chrome from providing security.</p>
    <p>To fix the problem, turn off your antivirus software. If the page works after turning off the software, turn off this software when you use secure sites.</p>
    <p>Remember to turn your antivirus program back on when you're done.</p>
    <h4>Step 5: Get extra help</h4>
    <p>If you still see the error, contact the website owner.</p><p>You'll see this error if you're using a Wi-Fi portal where you have to sign in before you can get online.</p>
